## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See slide in/out animations when clicking on the hamburg icon

### Links

- Live Site URL:[Live Site](https://happi89.github.io/animated-navigation/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS animations

### Continued development

I might combine this and my other projects light/dark mode and animated template website to create my portfolio!

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation) - This helped me for understanding and using animations. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
